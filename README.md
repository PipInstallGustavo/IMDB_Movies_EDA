# IMDB Movies Analysis EDA Project - (2006-2016)<br>

<b>About the Dataset:</b> <br>
This project focuses on the analysis of popular movies from the IMDB dataset, which contains detailed metadata for 1,000 films. The goal is to explore trends, patterns, and relationships within the dataset and derive meaningful insights.

The dataset used in this project is sourced from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data">Kaggle</a> and includes key information about each movie, such as:
<ul>
        <li>Title</li>
        <li>Year</li>
        <li>Genre</li>
        <li>Director</li>
        <li>Actors</li>
        <li>Plot</li>
        <li>Language</li>
        <li>Country</li>
        <li>IMDB Rating</li>
        <li>IMDB Votes</li>
        <li>Revenue</li>
        <li>Runtime</li>
        <li>Metascore</li>
</ul> <br>

<b>Main Goals:</b>
<ul>
  <li>To explore the distribution of movie ratings, genres, and runtime;</li>
  <li>To identify correlations between movie features, such as the relationship between budget and revenue;</li>
  <li>Identify the top-rated or highest-grossing movies in the dataset and analyze commonalities such as directors, actors, or genres among them;</li>
  <li>Examine how certain directors or actors affect a movie's rating or box office performance. For example, do certain directors consistently produce highly rated or financially successful films?</li>
</ul><br>

<b>Conclusion:</b>
<p>We've analysed the dataset containing the 1000 most famous movies between the 2006-2016 gap. By that, we can conclude a few things:

<ol>
    <li>2016 was the worst year in terms of Revenue. Mean Rating is also below average.</li>
    <li>The most famous movie genres are <b>Action</b>, <b>Adventure</b>, <b>Thriller</b>, <b>Sci-fi</b> and <b>Drama</b>.</li>
    <li>We noticed that the high rating doesnt really imply on high revenue, but all movies with a revenue over 400 million dollars have a ratinfg of at least 7/10.</li>
    <li>Ridley Scott was the Director with the most appearences on the top 1000. Also, James Cameron, Colin Trevorrow and Joss Whedon were the ones with the highest mean revenue. </li>
    <li>Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale were the actors with most appearences, with 11 participations each.</li>
    <li>On the top 20 most voted movies list, Christopher Nolan had 5 appearences as a director.</li>
</ol>
